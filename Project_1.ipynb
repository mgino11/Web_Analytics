    "Your task in this week’s assignment is to identify an interesting set of network data that is available on the web\n",
    "(either through web scraping or web APIs) that could be used for analyzing and comparing centrality measures across nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an additional constraint, there should be at least one categorical variable available for each node\n",
    "(such as “Male” or “Female”; “Republican”, “Democrat,” or “Undecided”, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to identifying your data source, you should create a high level plan that describes how you would load the data for analysis,\n",
    "and describe a hypothetical outcome that could be predicted from comparing degree centrality across categorical groups.\n",
    "For this week’s assignment, you are not required to actually load or analyze the data.  Please see also Project 1 below.\n",
    "You may work in a small group on the assignment.   You should post your document to GitHub by end of day on Sunday."

    "In our project, we take a look at a network of stocks and institutional holders.  Instiutional holders include any mutual or pension funds, insurance company, investment firms, private foudnation, endowment, or other large entities that manage funds on behalf others.  In our social network analysis, our nodes are either a stock or institutional holder and the edges are interactions between the institutional holder and stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conduct our analysis, we use a Dow Jones Industrial Average dataset to extract the ticker information and use the yfinance package to pull the institutional holder dataframes.\n",

    "The Dow Industrial Average consist of the 30 companies and the index weight of each.  The yfinanace package is an open source tool that uses Yahoo's publicly available APIs.  It offers a threaded Pythonic way to download data from Yahoo finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis will begin with extraction, transformation, and loading of the desired data. Next, we create and perform basic exploration of the social network. Finally, we will perform an analysis by categorical groups."

        "Using any of the three classifiers described in chapter 6 of Natural Language Processing with Python, and any features you can think of, build the best name gender classifier you can. Begin by splitting the Names Corpus into three subsets: 500 words for the test set, 500 words for the dev-test set, and the remaining 6900 words for the training set. Then, starting with the example name gender classifier, make incremental improvements. Use the dev-test set to check your progress. Once you are satisfied with your classifier, check its final performance on the test set. How does the performance on the test set compare to the performance on the dev-test set? Is this what you'd expect?"

        "Now with this list of features we will evaluate our classifier against the testing set. We get a slightly worse accuracy of 0.826 which implies some possible slight overfitting to the dev_test set. An additional way to expand this classifier is by identifiying and applying different features to the names if they can be bucketed into languages of origin (i.e. \"Georgiamay\", \"Hpephzibah\", \"Bobby\", \"Andrei\" may be derived from different languages originally and thus may have different rules for the gender idneticifaction of their names). \n",
